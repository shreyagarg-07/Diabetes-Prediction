Since Pregnancies represents the number of pregnancies (a discrete variable), and Outcome represents the diabetes outcome (a binary categorical variable), the chi-square test is appropriate to determine if there is a significant association between these variables. Additionally, the chi-square test helps to assess whether any observed association is statistically significant or occurred by chance."
